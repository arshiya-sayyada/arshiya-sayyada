### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer who loves to make new things. I have a Masters degree in Computer Science from NYU but I also have a great love for stories. I look at every project as a story. I look at the beginning (the inputs), the end (the end result I want) and take my code through the journey of getting from the start to the finish. I believe every file, every code snippet fits into this journey like a puzzle piece and my favorite feeling is when all the puzzle pieces slot together. I'm currently working on my portfolio website which will be hosted at [arshiya-sayyada.github.io](arshiya-sayyada.github.io). Take a look around to see what I've made so far!

I am actively seeking full time opportunites in the following roles:
1. Software Engineer
2. Front End Engineer
3. Full Stack Engineer
4. Web Developer
5. Android Developer

Feel free to send me an email at [mailto](mailto:arshiya.sayyada@nyu.edu) if you would like to connect!
